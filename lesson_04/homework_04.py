Tom gave up the brush with reluctance in his .... face but alacrity

"Big Missouri" worked ....

in the sun,

munched his apple, and planned the slaughter of more innocents.
There was no lack of material;
boys happened along every little while;

By the time Ben was fagged out, Tom had traded the next chance to Billy Fisher for
a kite, in good repair;

poor poverty, stricken boy in the .... morning, Tom was literally
rolling in wealth."""
